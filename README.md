The Python script utilizes the Pillow library to load and display an image.It performs the following tasks:
1) Imports Libraries: It imports the necessary modules from Pillow for image handling and IPython for displaying images inline.
2) Loads an Image: The script opens an image file (ensure the correct file path is provided).
3) Displays Image Properties: It prints the size and mode of the image to the console, giving insight into its dimensions and color format.
4) Shows the Image: The image is displayed in the default image viewer or within a Jupyter notebook using IPython's display capabilities.

The Python script uses the Matplotlib library to load, display, and save an image.It includes the following steps:
1) Imports Libraries: It imports the pyplot module for image visualization and image module for reading image files.
2) Loads an Image: The script reads an image file using mpimg.imread(), which loads the image data into an array.
3) Displays the Image: The image is displayed using plt.imshow(), with axes hidden for a cleaner presentation.
4) Saves the Image: Finally, the image is saved to the current directory or a specified path with a new filename, preserving its dimensions using bbox_inches='tight'.
